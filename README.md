# Crispy Tender : The Story

It is a dynamic web app which purpose is to enhance an optimal user experience while navigating and exploring the different parts.

The first step is to push the limits of animation and interactivity, creating a lively environment and after that implement a personalized experience based on their preferences.

## Purpose

My _very_ first concern as a _very_ junior developer is to learn and apply different concepts, both technical or structural and lay the foundations of a vast knowledge and understanding of the web development process.

## Technical challenges (before start):

### Frontend:

- **React** : I will use React to build all the UI components and the whole interface, the challenge will be to maintain a clear and logical structure throughout the whole process. Also to dive in more depth in React's functioning, eg. hooks, routes, ...

- **CSS/JS** :
  Implement dynamic and animated features in the app, starting with a **Parallax scroll animation** and further button actions, the purpose is to push the **CSS** boundaries and explore the multiple uses of it.
- **Tailwind** : I will implement a Tailwind methodology for a **responsive** design.
  I am already familiar with **css** and **sass** and enjoy the workflow as it keeps everything organized and separated. I still do believe that **Tailwind** can bring great value for responsive design and everything position-related, while the more specific styling could be kept using **sass** and its _\_mixins_ and _\_variables_.

- **HTML5** :
Use proper syntax in Html, keep a logical structure and implement at its best all the **accessibility** features.
<!-- - **Redux** : I will be using Redux to manage the global state of the application -->

### Backend:

- **To Determine**
